# WARN - these lists of known spam, tracking, malware, etc
# are very large and will create a database of over 1 MILLION
# sites.  Some of the entries may cause you issues when browsing and
# you'll need to whitelist individual domains from a list.
# I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE FOR NOVICES, wait until you try the
# default lists already provided and see what isn't blocked, then slowly
# add one list at a time until you have a lot of things blocked that are
# annoyances, dangerous, or violate your privacy
#
# Once you "subscribe" to one of these lists, Pihole will automatically
# keep your local database updated weekly with the latest versions of these lists
